It is terrifying to post your musings for the public to see. But it is also equally terrifying to not have a voice in a time where everyone is yelling over each other. I want to carve out a space of my own on the Internet. A place where I am not tied down by the safety regulations for not thinking correctly. 

More importantly, I want to learn to cultivate my voice. I want articulate my amorphous thoughts and breathe life to inchoate ideas floating in my head. It is easy to live out life without having your beliefs seriously challenged. I can just surround themselves with a group of like-minded, agreeable yes-sayers and express my own opinion with impunity. Or I can live out their life being one of the yes-sayers and be unwilling to speak out for what you believe in. If I were to really live in these ways, I can see my reluctance decaying quickly into impotence. When the time comes that I have to use my voice, I will not be surprised to find out that I can utter nothing but soft whispers. 

The essays I post is a means of making myself accountable for my own development. Writing to an audience (imaginary or otherwise) will force me to sharpen my arguments and contend with pushbacks against what I believe in. 

More importantly, these series of posts will serve as an archive for many of the materials that I have wrestled with in my academic journey. It is a nice way of remembering who I was. A diachronic account of the knowledge i accumulated throughout the years. It can also function as a convenient way to refresh myself on the knowledge that I may have forgotten.
